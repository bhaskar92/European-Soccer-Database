Foreign Keys
Country and League are referenced in the Match table by their primary key (id). Matches and Players are linked to other tables by 
foreign keys *match_api_id* and *player_api_id*. These keys are different from the table's primary keys (id). I have deliberately made
the joint on these *api_id* to be consistent with the original data sources
